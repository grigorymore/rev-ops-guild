# Update 0.001 — Building the Operating Stack

Hello, builders!

I'm assembling the operating stack for our RevOps builders' community so we can grow and move forward together.

## What’s in the first stack

- Knowledge base: a shared space for our notes, guild docs, and member list
- GitHub as the source of truth: the latest version will always live here → [grigorymore/rev-ops-guild](https://github.com/grigorymore/rev-ops-guild)
- Obsidian for viewing: easiest way to browse the knowledge base locally; a public web view will come later
- Open backlog: a transparent list of what we’re building next
- Slack channel `#build-guild`: follow for updates and to contribute to the backlog

If you want to help shape the stack or add ideas, jump into `#build-guild` or open a PR in the repo.
