# Build the Guild

Hello! This group is about community management and building.

Here I gather everyone who wants to develop the community itself with me, not just be a listener or participant in peer groups.

## Currently setting up the basic community setup

- **Welcome messages** — intro requests, navigation through main channels, invitation to community development
- **Collecting the first member base** — saving intros from Slack to the shared knowledge base and Google spreadsheet with members
- **Assistants for conducting peer groups and activities**
- **Assistants collecting draft digests into the knowledge base**

## Want to participate in community development?

- Book a slot for a short call
- Send an email → I'll send access to Linear with all projects
- We'll create a separate branch in our repository
- And together we'll build community interaction

## Infrastructure

- Git: source of truth for community OS
- Obsidian: knowledge base viewing and editing
- Slack: communication space
- Linear: open backlog and task flow
