# **The craft of building systems that grow**

I’ve realized I’ve been shaping things — marketing projects, dashboards, analytics, funnels, data models, business systems — for more than 10 years now.

These are my clay pots. My hands know how the clay moves — where it’s too thin, where to trim, where the wheel spins too fast. Maybe you’ve noticed this in your own craft too — your predictive model just _clicks_. You can feel when something’s off before it happens. You lose a few illusions, but gain precision.

For me, a new layer is opening now — **AI**. Watching tools start to truly talk to each other, become autonomous, and amplify what we can do — that’s exciting again.

We built a few AI content systems at Vuln, and now I can create in Cursor what used to take a full SaaS. It’s impossible not to see the shift. At first, it felt like machines were taking over the craft.

Now I feel the opposite — it’s a new playground for craftsmanship.But with this excitement came a sense of isolation. I’ve been the solitary potter for a while — now I want a guild.

A place for other potters of systems.
